# airtag tracker

This project contains a bash script that collects Apple AirTag data on a regular interval and a Jupyter Notebook for creating maps from that data. I primarily developed this to track my outdoor cat [Carl](https://www.instagram.com/carl37209/).

Dependencies:
- [`jq`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq)
